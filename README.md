# Sky Play Technical Test iOS
Develop a simple iOS app that displays a list of Marvel characters and their details using the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/).

## Requirements:
The application should consist of two screens:
### Character List screen: 
- Displays a list of Marvel characters with their names and thumbnail images
### Character Detail screen: 
- Shows the selected character's details, such as name, description, and additional information
## Expectations:
- The character list should be displayed in a table view or collection view. Tapping on a character should navigate to the character detail screen
- Implement pagination for the character list, loading additional characters as the user scrolls to the bottom
- Feel free to use any architecture pattern you are familiar with. Preference is more modular and scalable code
- Use SOLID principles when necessary
- Use of swiftUI is must
- Write required Unittests
- Documentation comments are encouraged

## Addtional Information:
- To retrieve the necessary data, you will need to acquire an API key from the Marvel Developer Portal (https://developer.marvel.com/). This API key will grant you access to the Marvel API, enabling you to fetch the required information for your application.
